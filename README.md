# Backwards-chain
Backward chaining is an inference method that can be described (in lay terms) as working backward from the goal(s). It is used in automated theorem provers, inference engines, proof assistants and other artificial intelligence applications.
The format for the rules are as follows
First line is the goal you are trying to reach. So a single atom.
The rest of the lines are rules . eg a^b=>c. which is written as c a b.
and rules that are a single atom eg. b.  are just facts.
